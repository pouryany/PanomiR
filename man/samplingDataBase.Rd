\arguments{
\item{enrichNull}{Enrichment dataset with x (miRNA), y (pathway) and pval
(probability of observing x in pathway cluster).}

\item{selector}{Table with x(miRNA) in pathway cluster.}

\item{sampRate}{Sampling rate.}

\item{fn}{Methodology function.}

\item{nPaths}{Number of pathways in pathway cluster.}

\item{samplingDataFile}{If file exists, load. Else, perform random sampling}

\item{jackKnife}{If TRUE, conduct sampling with one less pathway, used for
jack knifing}

\item{saveSampling}{If TRUE, data is saved.}

\item{numCores}{number of cores used}

\item{autoSeed}{random permutations are generated based on predetermined 
seeds. TRUE will give identical results in different runs.}
